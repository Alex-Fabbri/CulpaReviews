I worked on the Flask aspect of the project and integrating the parts together to display our results. http://flask.pocoo.org/ contains many good examples that walk you through the steps of making a flask app and was very helpful. At first I made the app.py completely separate of any functionality to just show some text. I learned to make use of decatorators as they are the key component of the functions that change pages in the app. I created a page.html and a results.html to change pages and display the results from the user input. I modified some of the initial functions to make sure they return strings or lists which will be easy to display. I encountered some initial troubles when I tried to neatly display strings as the newline characters do not inherently show up. To fix this I inserted <br/> in the strings that the function returns and modified the results.html file for example to return {{prof_quotes|safe}}, where the safe modification makes sure that these breaks are implemented. Any css is just added in-line. I do some basic error checking using regular expressions to test the link inserted. Essential to changing webpages was understanding the render_template function that returns the webpages and allows you to fill in information returned from functions. Overall I found Flask to be very well-documented with plenty of examples which helped and stackoverflow usually contained direct answers to any errors that resulted.
